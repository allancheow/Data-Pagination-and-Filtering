# Title
Treehouse Project #02  
	Data Pagination and Filtering
<br>

# Overview
In this project, used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.  

Started with a file which contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. Using your JavaScript to display the first nine students on the page, then add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, where the user can click to display different pages of students.  

This application will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This means the solutions needs to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.  

Code is written using plain JavaScript, sometimes known as “vanilla” JavaScript. Avoid using jQuery or any other libraries, plugins, or code snippets for any aspect of this project, including the pagination.
